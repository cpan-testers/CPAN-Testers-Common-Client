### CPAN-Testers-Common-Client ###

Common code for CPAN Testers' clients

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/garu/CPAN-Testers-Common-Client.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/garu/CPAN-Testers-Common-Client)

This module provides a common client for constructing metabase facts and
the legacy email message sent to CPAN Testers in a way that is properly
parsed by the extraction and report tools. It is meant to be used by all
the CPAN clients (and standalone tools) that want/need to support the
CPAN Testers infrastructure.

For the complete documentation, please refer to:
